title: SAMPLE SPACE
---

<h2>Infinitely large sample spaces</h2>
		<p>In an elementary approach to probability, any subset of the sample space is usually called an event. However, this gives rise to problems when the sample space is continuous, so that a more precise definition of an event is necessary. Under this definition only measurable subsets of the sample space, constituting a Ïƒ-algebra over the sample space itself, are considered events.</p>
