<h2>Equally likely outcomes</h2>
	
		<p>Some treatments of probability assume that the various outcomes of an experiment are always defined so as to be equally likely. However, there are experiments that are not easily described by a sample space of equally likely outcomesâ€”for example, if one were to toss a thumb tack many times and observe whether it landed with its point upward or downward, there is no symmetry to suggest that the two outcomes should be equally likely.</p>
		
		<p>Though most random phenomena do not have equally likely outcomes, it can be helpful to define a sample space in such a way that outcomes are at least approximately equally likely, since this condition significantly simplifies the computation of probabilities for events within the sample space. If each individual outcome occurs with the same probability, then the probability of any event becomes simply:</p>

		<p><b><i>P(event)</i> = number of outcomes in event / number of outcomes in sample space</b></p>

		<p>For example, if two dice are thrown to generate two uniformly distributed integers, D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, each in the range [1...6], the 36 ordered pairs (D<sub>1</sub> , D<sub>2</sub>) constitute a sample space of equally likely events. In this case, the above formula applies, such that the probability of a certain sum, say D<sub>1</sub> + D<sub>2</sub> = 5 is easily shown to be 4/36, since 4 of the 36 outcomes produce 5 as a sum. On the other hand, the sample space of the 11 possible sums, {2, ...,12} are not equally likely outcomes, so the formula would give an incorrect result (1/11).</p>
