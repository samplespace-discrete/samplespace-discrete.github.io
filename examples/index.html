Summary: The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes for that experiment. You may have noticed that for each of the experiments above, the sum of the probabilities of each outcome is 1. This is no coincidence. The sum of the probabilities of the distinct outcomes within a sample space is 1.

The sample space for choosing a single card at random from a deck of 52 playing cards is shown below. There are 52 possible outcomes in this sample space.

Cards

The probability of each outcome of this experiment is:

P(card)	 = 	 1 
52
The sum of the probabilities of the distinct outcomes within this sample space is:

52	 = 	1
