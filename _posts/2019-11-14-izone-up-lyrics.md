*IZ*ONE - Up*

Let's go up high to the end of the blue sky
You and I together, forever together
Look around, look at the world
The scenery where we were together are beautifully spread across

Let’s meet eyes and breathe heavily
Whoo woo whoo woo
Our faces are spreading without limitations across the wide sky in blue
Please hold me hand

Go up the the end of the sky
Go above the clouds
The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across
I wish the time would stop

To the sky, you and I
To the sky, we fly up
To the sky
Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn't matter
To the sky
Go up, go up, go up

When the cool breeze grazes my cheeks
Our memories, with a smile on our face
Write it on the clouds so it won’t disappear
Whenever I want to see it, I'll be the only one to take it out and see it

Let's meet eyes and breathe heavily
Whoo woo whoo woo
Our faces are spreading without limitations across the wide sky in blue
Please hold me hand

Go up the the end of the sky
Go above the clouds
The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across
I wish the time would stop

To the sky, you and I
To the sky, we fly up
To the sky
Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn't matter
To the sky
Go up, go up, go up

My heart that floats, you and I inside the clouds
Our image that reflects upon your eyes
I want to give every pretty thing to you
My love

The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across
I wish the time would stop

To the sky, whenever it is, always remember this day
To the sky, let's call each others' names
To the sky
Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn’t matter
To the sky
Go up, go up, go up
