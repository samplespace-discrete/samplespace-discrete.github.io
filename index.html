	<h1>SAMPLE SPACE</h1>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>
		In probability theory, the sample space (also called sample description space[1] or possibility space[2]) of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.[3] A sample space is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes are listed as elements in the set. It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels S, Î©, or U (for "universal set").

		For example, if the experiment is tossing a coin, the sample space is typically the set {head, tail}. For tossing two coins, the corresponding sample space would be {(head,head), (head,tail), (tail,head), (tail,tail)}, commonly written {HH, HT, TH, TT}. If the sample space is unordered, it becomes {[head,head], [head,tail], [tail,tail]}.

		For tossing a single six-sided die, the typical sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (in which the result of interest is the number of pips facing up).[4]

		A well-defined sample space is one of three basic elements in a probabilistic model (a probability space); the other two are a well-defined set of possible events (a sigma-algebra) and a probability assigned to each event (a probability measure function).

		<h2>Conditions of a sample space</h2>
	
		<p>
		A set {\displaystyle \Omega }\Omega  with outcomes {\displaystyle s_{1},s_{2},\ldots ,s_{n}}{\displaystyle s_{1},s_{2},\ldots ,s_{n}} (i.e. {\displaystyle \Omega =\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots ,s_{n}\}}{\displaystyle \Omega =\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots ,s_{n}\}}) must meet some conditions in order to be a sample space:

		The outcomes must be mutually exclusive, i.e. if {\displaystyle s_{j}}s_{j} takes place, then no other {\displaystyle s_{i}}s_{i} will take place, {\displaystyle \forall i,j=1,2,\ldots ,n\quad i\neq j}{\displaystyle \forall i,j=1,2,\ldots ,n\quad i\neq j}.
		The outcomes must be collectively exhaustive, i.e., on every experiment (or random trial) there will always take place some outcome {\displaystyle s_{i}\in \Omega }{\displaystyle s_{i}\in \Omega } for {\displaystyle i\in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}}{\displaystyle i\in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}}.
		The sample space ({\displaystyle \Omega }\Omega ) must have the right granularity depending on what we are interested in. We must remove irrelevant information from the sample space. In other words, we must choose the right abstraction (forget some irrelevant information).
		For instance, in the trial of tossing a coin, we could have as a sample space {\displaystyle \Omega _{1}=\{H,T\}}{\displaystyle \Omega _{1}=\{H,T\}}, where {\displaystyle H}H stands for heads and {\displaystyle T}T for tails. Another possible sample space could be {\displaystyle \Omega _{2}=\{H\&R,H\&NR,T\&R,T\&NR\}}{\displaystyle \Omega _{2}=\{H\&R,H\&NR,T\&R,T\&NR\}}. Here, {\displaystyle R}R stands for rains and {\displaystyle NR}NR not rains. Obviously, {\displaystyle \Omega _{1}}\Omega _{1} is a better choice than {\displaystyle \Omega _{2}}\Omega _{2} as we do not care about how the weather affects the tossing of a coin.
