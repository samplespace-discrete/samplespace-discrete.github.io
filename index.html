	<h1>SAMPLE SPACE</h1>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>In probability theory, the sample space (also called sample description space[1] or possibility space[2]) of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.[3] A sample space is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes are listed as elements in the set. It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels S, Î©, or U (for "universal set").

For example, if the experiment is tossing a coin, the sample space is typically the set {head, tail}. For tossing two coins, the corresponding sample space would be {(head,head), (head,tail), (tail,head), (tail,tail)}, commonly written {HH, HT, TH, TT}. If the sample space is unordered, it becomes {[head,head], [head,tail], [tail,tail]}.

For tossing a single six-sided die, the typical sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (in which the result of interest is the number of pips facing up).[4]

A well-defined sample space is one of three basic elements in a probabilistic model (a probability space); the other two are a well-defined set of possible events (a sigma-algebra) and a probability assigned to each event (a probability measure function).</p>
